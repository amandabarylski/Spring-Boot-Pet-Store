SPRING BOOT CODING ASSIGNMENT: PET STORE
This assignment is a three week project to write a pet store REST API.

WEEK ONE (Week 13 Coding Assignment):
1. Show that you can properly create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), complete with
entities and relationship lines.
2. Demonstrate how to create a Maven project.
3. Show how to modify the generic pom.xml with content created in the Spring Initializr
Website.
4. Demonstrate that you can create Java Persistence API (JPA) entities.
5. Show understanding of Spring JPA configuration.
6. Demonstrate that you can create a Spring Boot main class that starts Spring Boot and
configures itself as a Web application.
7. Show that the JPA entities can be used by Spring JPA to create schema tables
complete with relationships.

WEEK TWO (Week 14 Coding Assignment):
1. Demonstrate knowledge of Spring Boot best practices by writing a multi-layer
application including the input/output layer, the service layer, and the data layer.
2. Show mastery of Spring JPA by writing a service-layer method that both inserts and
updates pet store data.
3. Understand Spring Boot mechanics by using a Data Transfer Object (DTO) for
application data input and output (as opposed to using the JPA entities, which will
cause your application to go BOOM without special processing).

WEEK THREE (Week 15 Coding Assignment):
1. Demonstrate ability to manage Spring JPA relationships by adding child rows in a oneto-
many relationship and a many-to-many relationship.
2. Show continued mastery of Spring JPA by coding the retrieve pet store and delete pet
store operations.
